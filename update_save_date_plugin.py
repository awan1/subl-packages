"""Key-binding-activated command that automatically updates the
date-last-modified section in a file with each save.

Only thing the user has to change (if they so wish) are the variables
Header_Format and/or Date_Format.

Code adapted from hintermair's answer on: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28032780/automatic-update-date-in-sublime-by-save

NOTE: Only change the variables Header_Format and/or Date_Format.
The rest of the code should remain untouched.
